# Logistics Digital Transformation (CRM + ERP) — Work Sample (Sanitised)

This repository contains a **single supporting artefact** (PPT deck) summarising a **digital transformation project for a regional logistics company**, delivered using **Microsoft Power Platform / Dataverse** (model-driven app) with API-based integration.

It’s intended as a companion to my CV bullet point, providing additional context on the problem, approach, solution design, and outcomes at a high level.

## Context (project scope and my role)
On this engagement, I led the **design and delivery** of a tailored **CRM + ERP** solution to support core logistics operations. My responsibilities included:
- Supporting agile delivery across build/test/release activities (including backlog coordination and release planning).
- Designed and delivered a Dataverse-backed model-driven app (tables, relationships, forms/views, security roles) for CRM + logistics operations.
- Implemented workflow logic using business rules + form JavaScript, plus automated notifications for operational events and deal closure.
- Integrated a shipment tracking REST API to surface container milestones and keep operational data current.
- Produced Power BI dashboards over Dataverse for logistics performance KPIs.

## Contents
- **01_Logistics_Digital_Transformation_Summary.pptx** — Project overview deck covering context, key requirements, solution approach (model-driven app + integrations), and delivery summary.

> **Confidentiality / access note:** The original model-driven app and environment assets are not included. The solution was delivered in the client’s tenant and I no longer have access to that environment; additionally, client privacy and confidentiality constraints prevent sharing extractable app components.

## How to use
Open the PPT deck above. It is the primary (and only) artefact in this repository.

## Confidentiality note
Client/project identifiers have been removed where applicable. This artefact is shared to demonstrate delivery approach and solution design at a high level.
