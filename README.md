# Logistics Digital Transformation — Work Sample (Sanitised)

This repository contains a **single supporting artefact** (PPT deck) summarising a **digital transformation project for a logistics company**, delivered using **Microsoft Power Platform / Dataverse** (model-driven app) with API-based integration.

It’s intended as a companion to my CV bullet point, providing additional context on the problem, approach, solution design, and outcomes at a high level.

> **Confidentiality / access note:** The original model-driven app and environment assets are not included. The solution was delivered in the client’s tenant and I no longer have access to that environment; additionally, client privacy and confidentiality constraints prevent sharing extractable app components.
